The represented [aivika-experiment](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-experiment) package 
allows defining simulation experiments based on the [aivika](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika)
and [aivika-transformers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-transformers) packages. 
Such experiments define in declarative manner what should be simulated and in which view 
the simulation results should be generated. It can directly return charts, tables and so on. 
Additionally, it can save the results in SQL databases.

The library is extensible and you can add new views for the results.
